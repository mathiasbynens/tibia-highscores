# Tibia highscores

This repository contains scripts to collect Tibia highscores across various categories and to compute new highscores based on them, including Corrected Achievements highscores (removing points for coinciding achievements which can only be obtained by rooking the character) as well as Completionists highscores [as pioneered by TibiaLD](https://web.archive.org/web/20230304223730/https://tibiald.com/2023/02/10/introducing-highscores/).
